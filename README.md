# 2AFC Bayesian Observer with Efficient Coding Constraint 
Implementing the efficient coding framework in Wei, X. X., & Stocker, A. A. (2015) for maximum likelihood fitting in 2AFC tasks.  

This version uses the implementation with mapping to a homogeneous space, as it was introduced originally in the Wei & Stocker (2015) paper. It handles small noise regime pretty well.
